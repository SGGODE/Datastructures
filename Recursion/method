                            *base condition 
                            
step 1
  hypothesis design
  print(7)=1 2 3 4 5 6 7
  print(n-1)
  step2 
  induction
void print(n){
  if(n==1)  //base condition
    return 1;
   print(n-1); //hypothesis  what you have design your function
   cout<<n<<" ";//induction step
   }
   
 question on recursion
 the recursion base good questions need recursion tree to solve it
 easy can be done on the basices of IBH(induction base hypothesis
 medium can be done on the basices of recursion tree
 hard will need the choice diagram
