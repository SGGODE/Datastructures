recursion
decision that make input small

if you want a big package job than to make this problem small you take the 
admission in a good college such as IIT or NIT than your problem will be 
small but if you cannot then you need to be more strong in your skills to get
the jobs so that how recurdsion work.

choice are given and you want to make decision for it will be answer

recursive tree
input output method
examplr is the all possible subset of abc

                     op  ip
               
        op1 smaller ip     op1 smaller ip 
        
op1'smaller     op1''
    ip           smallerip              ---------- 
    
    
# of branches is equal to # of choices

                                       op=" "ip="ab"
                                                                      decision
                          op=""ip="b"                  op="a"ip="b"
                                                                                      decision
               op=""ip=""          op="b"ip=""    op="a"ip=""       op="ab"ip=""
               ------------        -----------    ----------        ------------
 we get answer when the input is empty
