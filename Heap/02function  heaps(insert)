//insertion in heap
there are two important thinks to remember here
1.it should maintain the property of heap that is min/max
2.it should be complete binary tree
so as we know that it is stored as array
here we can just increase the size of array and insert the element in last
but as per both condition we need to make some changes
we just compare the inserted node with its parent node 
and swap it
//here i am going to do this on minheap according to maxheap condition will change
class minheap{
  int arr[];
  int size;
  int capacity;
  minheap(int c){
   int arr=new int[c];
   int size=0;
   int capacity=c;
   }
   void insert(int x){                                     //x is element that we want to insert
     if(size=capacity)
       return;
     size++;
     arr[size-1]=x;
     for(int i=size-1;i!=0;arr[parent(i)]>arr[i]){        //condition according to min heap
       swap(arr[parent(i)],arr[i]);
       i=parent(i);
       }
 };
 imp interview question 
   time complexcity of insert in heap is O(logn)
