BUILD HEAP
Given a random array 
Given
[10,5,20,2,4,8]
output minheap     maxheap
[2,4,8,5,10,20]    [20,20,8,2,4,5]

buid heap 
pick(bottom most right most internal node)

 consider
    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
  we need to select that element which is bottom most right most and internal also(we are finding the parent of our last element of heap)
   in this case we select 
   that will be 4 for us try to draw heap for better understanding
   then we will call our heapify function for 4 and then followed by 
   3 and 2 and 1 and at last 0
   here selecting that element which will transfer for hepify is most 
   important
   and then followed by hepify convert the heap that we have in proper minheap/maxheap according to given writen function
   
   formula for lastnode is (size-1)
   lastnode parent is |((size-1)-1)/2|
   and then we just call for hepify by decresing nodes
   
   void buidheap(){
    for(int i=((size-2)/2);i>=0;i--){
      hepify(i);
      }
    }
    Time complexity is O(n);
