consider you have a canteen
you need to store food that you have with there value
 as we can say it as key-value pairs
  maggi-15
  colddrink-19
 
 operations that we on this and with there repective
  time complexity
  insert(pizza,199)  O(1) 
  search(maggi)   15 O(1)
  erase(colddrink)  O(1)
  
  why we don't use array
  Array<pair<string,int>>
  or a vector is that time complexity                              both array/vector and hashtable take similar space but tc are much different
    if you are searching,inserting,deleting 
    it take O(n) or O(log n)
    but hashtable take only O(1)
    that why we use it 
  not ordered internely
