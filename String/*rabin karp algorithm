Given text and pattern we need to find pattern in our text

text=aaaaab n size
pattern=aab m size

we just start with creating hashcode i.e adding ascii value of pattern char
then we just perfrom rolling of hash function i.e we just traverse over text of
length pattern and add ascii value and compare with the hashcode if match 
we compare actual char if not then we just move forward as we are can by adding
next char of text and removing last char of text and comapring the value;

so this is basic idea of rabin karp algorithm
O(n-m+1) average case

drawback of algo is sparious hits
 i.e hashcode is matching many time but after comparsion it is not that pattern 
 
 example 
  text= ccaccaaedba                     a=1 to e=5
  pattern=dbc
   hashcode is 7 so there are many hashcode matching but not pattern every time
   O(m*n)
   worst case
