 string: The stringstream class in C++ allows a string object to be treated as a stream. It is used to operate on strings

basic program to calculate number of words in a string

#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include<string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string s="Hello World";
    stringstream ss(s);
    string word;
    int c=0;
    while(ss>>word)
     c++;
     
     cout<<c;
    return 0;
}
//other also such as counting the number of occurence with the count of word in the string or paragraph
using map,pair and stringstream
