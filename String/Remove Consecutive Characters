Given a string S delete the characters which are appearing more than once consecutively.

Example 1:

Input:
S = aabb
Output:  ab 
Explanation: 'a' at 2nd position is
appearing 2nd time consecutively.
Similiar explanation for b at
4th position.

Your Task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function removeConsecutiveCharacter() which accepts a string as input parameter and returns modified string.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|).
 

Constraints:
1<=|S|<=105
All characters are lowercase alphabets.


class Solution{
    public:
    string removeConsecutiveCharacter(string S)
    {
        string p;
      char c=S[0];
      p.push_back(S[0]);
        for(int i=1;i<S.size();i++){
            if(S[i]!=c){
            p.push_back(S[i]);
            c=S[i];
            }
        }
        return p;
    }
};
